# CLI
Fielda's official command line tool; runs on Windows, macOS, or Linux without an installer or runtime.

# Getting Started

We publish [releases on GitHub](https://github.com/fielda/cli/releases). Since
there is no installer, just download the binary appropriate for your operating
system and [run the app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).
